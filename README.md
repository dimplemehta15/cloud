# ☁️ Introduction to Cloud and AWS

## 🌐 What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources** over the Internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**. Instead of buying and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access computing power, storage, databases, and more through the cloud.

### 🔑 Key Benefits
- Scalability
- Cost-efficiency
- High availability
- Speed and agility
- Global reach

## 🚀 What is AWS?

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is the **leading cloud service provider**, offering over 200 fully featured services such as computing, storage, networking, databases, machine learning, and more — from data centers globally.

## 🕰️ A Brief History of AWS

- **2002** – Amazon began offering web-based services such as SOAP and XML APIs for developers.
- **2006** – AWS officially launched with **S3 (Simple Storage Service)** and **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**. This was the birth of modern cloud infrastructure.
- **2010** – AWS moved Amazon.com’s retail infrastructure fully onto AWS.
- **2012–2015** – Rapid growth with launches of services like **Lambda (serverless)** and **Aurora (cloud-native database)**.
- **2020+** – AWS becomes a $100+ billion annual revenue business with millions of customers including Netflix, NASA, and the U.S. government.

### 🌟 Milestones
- AWS pioneered **IaaS** and helped shape the modern cloud landscape.

## 🌍 What are Regions and Availability Zones?

### 📍 Regions
AWS divides its global infrastructure into **Regions** — geographic areas where AWS data centers are located. Each region is isolated and independent to ensure fault tolerance and stability.

### 🏢 Availability Zones (AZs)
Each region consists of **2 or more Availability Zones**, which are **separate physical data centers** within that region. AZs are isolated from each other but connected through low-latency links, allowing you to build **highly available** and **fault-tolerant** applications.

### 🧭 Example

**US East (N. Virginia)**  
- Region Code: `us-east-1`  
- AZs: `us-east-1a`, `us-east-1b`, `us-east-1c`, etc.

**Europe (Frankfurt)**  
- Region Code: `eu-central-1`  
- AZs: `eu-central-1a`, `eu-central-1b`, `eu-central-1c`
